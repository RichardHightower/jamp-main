This project is not ready to be really looked at yet.
At one point, SEND was working over WebSocket, STOMP and REST/HTTP.

We are in the process of adding QUERY, REPLY, ERROR, and ERROR-QUERY.
It is broken at this point (unit tests work and some of the examples work).

Probably by the end of this week, all of the examples should be workign again.

I am going to write up a road map.

Once I get all of the RPC style communication working again, I am giong to create a release branch,
and call this version 0.01.

Then I am going to start working on the JavaScript client pieces for a while.
